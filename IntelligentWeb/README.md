### Installation & Running

Install the app by running `npm i` in the root (solution) directory. This will install the necessary `node_modules`.
To run the app, either run `bin/www` or use `nodemon` in the root (solution) directory

There is a User account created for testing without having to verify it:
- Email: test@user.com
- Password: Re5taurant

Alternatively, you can sign up with a new account, and use that. A verification email will be sent with a link to verify the account, so use a real email address if you intend to submit a Restaurant. The link in the email goes to localhost, so make sure you click the link on the computer running the project.
