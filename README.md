### Installation & Running

#### Dependencies

- MongoDB: a Mongo database is required and needs the releveant env vars to be connected to
- GMail: a GMail username and app-specific password is used for sending emails

#### Installation

Install the app by running `yarn` in the root directory. This will install the necessary `node_modules`.
To run the app, either run `bin/www` or use `nodemon` in the root directory

Seed data can be generated by running the `db_regen` script.

There is a User account created for testing without having to verify it:
- Email: test@user.com
- Password: Re5taurant

Alternatively, you can sign up with a new account, and use that. A verification email will be sent with a link to verify the account, so use a real email address if you intend to submit a Restaurant. The link in the email goes to `restaurant-critique.willgarside.me`, so you might need to change it if you're running it locally.

#### Environment Variables

These are the necessary environment variables, hopefully they're self-explanatory enough.

```
DATABASE_NAME
DATABASE_PASSWORD
DATABASE_URL
DATABASE_USERNAME
EMAIL_USERNAME
EMAIL_PASSWORD
```
